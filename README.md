Checkplease Application
---------------------

###Want to get things done?  Make a checklist

At Checkplease, you can create to-do lists or check-lists that can be assigned to yourself or someone else to complete.  They can be one-time, or recurring.  You can configure yourself to be notified of statistics when these tasks are completed.  Features include:
* Create a single checklist
* Create a "recurring" checklist, a new fully not-complete list will be generated each night
* Complete each list, and add notes as you complete
* Assign checklists to people via email
* Non complete lists will have reminders sent out each night
* If you assign a checklist to someone that doesn't have a checklist.cc account, they will have the list emailed to them.  As soon as they create an account, they can then go and complete those checklists.
* In the future I hope to build greater flexibility to meet the needs of the users.  Especially important to me is statistics and reporting on completed lists (perhaps sent via email)
