Checkplease Application
---------------------

###Want to get things done?  Make a checklist

At Checkplease, you can create to-do lists or check-lists that can be assigned to yourself or someone else to complete.  They can be one-time, or recurring.  You can configure yourself to be notified of statistics when these tasks are completed.  Features include:
* Create one-time, or recurring checklists
* Assign checklists to people via email
* Automatically send reminders of checklist information to users
* Track completion of these checklists
* For whoever you assign the list to, you can set whether they have to be a user of checklist (more secure) or not (anyone can complete the list, but the person emailed will be sent a secret URL)
